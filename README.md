# Recursion

I borrowed this little recursive algorithm from my Java book, to show how many times a method calls itself, when it tries to break down and analyze a String with a simple mathematics expression.    

At first sigh it was very difficult to see through the algorithm, but by walking step-by-step in debug mode it was clear how complex it really was.
